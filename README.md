# HOSPITAL LOCATOR
## Motivation & Background

The hospital locator project is a final project for the ALX 2022/23 Program Cohort 6 members.

The inspiration for the project stems from our need to provide users with a convenient way
to locate specialist hospitals around them using the mapping system.

The project is focused on Ghana and is looking to be expanded to global community.
